Please keep configuration as clean and minimal as possible.

## House rules

- Enables plugins/rules only on files that are intended to run the plugins/rules
   - For example, only use TypeScript parser on `*.ts`/`*.tsx` files, but not `*.js`/`*.jsx` files

## Roadmap

### ESLint 9 flat config

`@typescript-eslint/plugin` does not support ESLint 9 flat config yet.

When this is unblocked, we should update to use the flat config.
